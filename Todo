- Add a katakana mode with all of the requisite symbols.
- Ensure that each quiz has a different answer, because ocasionally the same answer will recur twice in a row
- Show both the romaji and the kana of the last correct answer on the screen for a bit after answering correctly
  ( but still move onto the next question )
- Alter the program to be generated from a backend script, and to support symbol sets that use images instead of
  font characters.
- Find a beautiful hand drawn set of hiragana ( inked ), and use those instead of the lower quality font
- Make it so that a configuration script allows a selection of various symbol sets by clicking a named group.
  ( to make it easier to use the tool for teaching when students are supposed to learn certain symbols at a certain
    time )
- Add a way that the system can supported registration/login, so that it can be used to test people
- Add timing, both so that you have to answer within a certain amount of time, and so that various stats can be
  shown about how well you did.
- Add a configurable option for the percentage of time kana is shown at the top versus romaji
